## Known issues

- Context menu action `Show Logs` is blocking, and blocks until a rebuild completes
- UX confusion risk: `Inspect` shows raw `id` fields

## Planned work

- Authenticate the CLI from VS Code
  - Install the CLI from VS Code
  - Run without the CLI installed

- Manage DevURLs
  - List, Open, Create, Delete, etc.
